This is a list of the types of documents and data we want to thread together.
It is based on Ben Goldacre's paper, Sam Smiths mockups and various internal
conversations. We're keen to know if there are other things we should be
targetting.

See also [Example Documents and Data](example_data_and_docs.md) which
gives real examples of some of these for you to see.
