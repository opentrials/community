The entire first run of the database will be on exact match of ID(s) and
titles. Once we have basic routines setup for that, weâ€™ll be basing decisions on
what we find as a result of actually trying to do things.

Having said that, we expect that the final solution will likely be based on the
following:

* Where two records share a common identifier, such as a Clinical Trial ID number, they can be simply merged. 
* Otherwise standard probabilistic record linkage techniques can be used on various features of the trial.

A summary of [record linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) can
be found on Wikipedia.

No work on probabilistic matching has begun yet but we will be looking for help
from experts in the field once we have a clearer idea of the specific problems
we're facing.
