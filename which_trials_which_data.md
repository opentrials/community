# Which trials and which data do you want to make accessible?

I think we are still deciding the details of this with the help of the
community, but things we want to include are:

*Data and documents on all trials past and present*

It is important to get historical data and documents because those contain the
evidence for the drugs we use _now_. We need current trial data so we know how
effective new drugs are and what the side-effects are.

*Medical trials*

We are only collecting data and documents in medical trials - for example
clinical trials, or device trials. We are not interested in economics research
for example.

*Humans*

We are only interested in trials on humans. Not vetinary trials on animals.

*Phases of Trials* 

QUESTION: I think we'd like information on trials of all phases - Phases 1,
Phase 2, Phase 3 (and Phase 4). Most of our efforts (and my knowledge) is
around Phase 3 trials at the moment.
