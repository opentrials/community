## About OpenTrials

OpenTrials is a project to create a single place for all the useful documents
and data that are produced as part of running clinical trials to find new
medical treatments.

The main OpenTrials website is at http://opentrials.net

If we want the best possible evidence-based medicine for the benefit of all, we
need all the evidence to be easily accessible.

## Technology

The technology-side of the projcet involves building a *spine* of information based on trial records in existing publicly-accessible registries, and then threading other documents and data through a data warehouse and a series of transforms. The technology side is now underway starting with the work to build the spine. The technology is described in the [OpenTrials Technology Roadmap](http://opentrials.net/2016/02/10/opentrials-technical-roadmap/).

## Community

The community-side of the project involves a few different things:

* Promoting the need for a single, open place to store all this research evidence
* Talking to people who want to use this evidence to understand how we can present it in a useful and linked way
* Talking to people who might have data they would like to share to understand how we can help them do that

## Community Repository

We're developing sets of resources that can be used to help strengthen and grow the community and we need somewhere to put these things before they are good enough to go on the main public webiste.

That's where this repository comes in. It is a place where ideas can be shared information collected for the community at large.

The usual caveats apply though - information here isn't necessarily correct,
accurate, or representative of what everyone in the community thinks. It is
just a place where we can start developing and sharing ideas and resources which might eventually help move the project forward. See also: [LICENCE](LICENSE.md)

If you are looking for more mature ideas, please visit the main website at http://opentrials.net

## Contributing 

If you'd like to contribute (either to these resources, or to the project as a
whole), the best thing to do would be to get in touch with the OpenTrials
Community Manager (James Gardner) via opentrials@okfn.org to have a chat about
how best you can help. Contributions are very welcome, so do get in touch.

Find out more in the [Contributing](contributing.md) document.

## Future

As an open community of contributors, it might be that we openly decide that there are better ways of organising the development of these resources and ideas, in which case we can use those in future.
