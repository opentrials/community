Terminology used in the world of clincial trials can be quite technical and
hard-to-understand for people that aren't experts in the field.

OpenTrials is about collecting all documents and data that make up the evidence
base of clinical trials and making it accessible in one place. That means as a
community, we need to make sure we are as inclusive as possible, and don't
exclude people who might be able to either contribute or benefit from the
project, simply because we are using over-technical language.

As a starting point on the way to developing a full standard it would be good
to see:

* Everything we write or present widely being understandable by an interested
  and enthusiastic 17 or 18 year old, and by adults of course

* A [Glossary](glossary.html) of common terms we tend to use, what they mean (in
  our context, to the best we can explain them without using other technical
  words) and where to go for more information
