## Background

This repository contains a set of documents that explain what we're trying to do. As they get more mature, we might publicly publish some of them on the main [OpenTrials website](http://opentrials.net).

## Format

Each document should be written in a format called *MarkDown*. MarkDown is just a plain text format that is deisgned to be very close to what you might write in a plain text email. It has a number of variants, but we'll use one called *GitHub-flavoured MarkDown*. If you don't know MarkDown yet, don't worry too much, we can accept contributions in other forms and one of us well just translate your document to MarkDown manually (as long as it isn't too complicated!). Or you can just start changing an existing document, and you'll probably not go too far wrong.

## Metadata

Each document should have a metadata section at the top that helps the person reading it understand some of the history of the document, who it is targetted at, and how mature it is.

When you first create a document it might look like this:

```

```

When you first update it, leave the `Created` information alone and add a new section `Last Updated` with your name and the date.

After the first revision the section might look like this:

```
~~~
Created: James Gardner, 2016-02-14
Last Updated: James Gardner, 2016-02-15

```

After any future changes you make, just replace the `Last Updated` information with your name and the latest date.

## Maturity

Over time the maturity of the document will improve going like this:

* Planning - Ideas that might later form a document, perhaps emailed around internally
* Pre-Alpha - Perhaps a first draft, or rough ideas to be refined, probably not worth taking notice of yet unless you are an author
* Alpha - Some of this information might be accurate, let's show it to people and get some initial feedback
* Beta - We think this is getting pretty good, so we need to show people publicly for any final tweaks
* Stable - This is in use publicly and is unlikely to change very quickly now
* Inactive - We don't use this anymore

## Getting Expert

If you want to get really expert, try not to leave any spaces at the end of
lines so that changes are easier to see.
