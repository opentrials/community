There are actually quite a few ways you can contribute to OpenTrials.

The high-level areas for contributions we'd like to see are listed here:

* http://opentrials.net/contribute/

More specifically, we're really interested in the following:

* If your organisation has some data that it could publish publicly, but is not
  doing so simply because there doesn't seem to be anywhere to put it yet, we'd
  like to talk to you. We're interested in finding out the sorts of issues
  organisations like yours have so that we can provide the right infrstrucutre
  to make it easier for you and others to make your data available.

* People who can write scapers for one of the data sources we've identified
  that we might be interested in [Public Data
  Sources](https://github.com/opentrials/registers/blob/master/data/registers.csv)

* People who can help write public-facing guideance to help explain to
  non-experts what we're really getting at.

* Tell us about anything you thought seemed strang to you (if you don't fully
  understand something on first reading, other people won't either so it is
  really useful to know about it, even if it seems trivial - it probably points
  to another problem elsewhere and at the very least could lead to a new entry
  or clarification in the [FAQ](FAQ.md))

* Tell us about things that are missing and that we should add. This could be:
  * People we should get in touch with about:
    * Possible new sources of data
    * Understanding how OpenTrials could help data providers
    * People who might would like to use OpenTrials so we can understand their needs

See the [Contributing](contributing.md) guide, for more ideas and how to get in touch.
