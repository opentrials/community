## Via Issue Tracker

The whole OpenTrials project has a public issue tracker here:

    https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues

Even without an account on GitHub, you should be able to create a new Issue
with your change.

To make sure we find it quickly you can also:

* Start the `Title` of the issue with the string `Community: `
* Add the text `@threeaims` in the comment area somewhere to notify the community manager
* Drop james.gardner@okfn.org an email too, just to make sure he sees it

The nice thing about an issue, is that it can be discussed publicly before a
decision is made about how best to action it.


## GitHub Users

If you are a [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) expert you can fork the repository,
add an issue, make your changes in a feature branch named with the issue number
and description e.g. `25-new-document` and submit a pull request for review.
