We all want OpenTrials to be an open community of organisations and users that
contribute and consume data.

This includes contributing to this community repository on policy, data
sources, types of documents and artices that can make their way onto the main
OpenTrials website.

This document explains how you can contribute to this *community repository*.

**Note**: There are lots of ways you can help the wider project too, some of
these are described in [Contribution Calls](contribution_calls.md).

##Â What

The main way you can help contribute to this repository is to:

* Read the files in the repository
* Submit improvements

There are loads of possible improvements, you can propose new paragraphs,
replacement text for existing paragraphs, new documents that should exits,
extra items to add to existing lists etc etc

## How

The easiest way to propose an improvement is to email the community manager at james.gardner@okfn.org with:

* The text you're proposing needs to be added or replaced
* How you would like to be added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` list

After review (see below), the community manager will **commit** your change to
the repository together with your name.

If you are a more technical person, you can contribute changes in other ways.
[Advanced Contributing](contributing_advanced.md)

## Review

Your contribution will be discussed and reviewed. If two members of the
OpenTrials community team agree to it, it will be accepted.

## Becoming a reviewer

Over time, people who contribute lots of accepted improvements generally earn
the right to be a reviewer themselves. This is based on the discression of the
exiting reviewers (currently the OpenTrials team). Any time there is any
dispute, Ben Goldacre has the final say, but obviously it is our job as
contributors to avoid getting into a situation where we ever have to ask Ben to
decide!
