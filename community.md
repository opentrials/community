There are lots of other projects in this and related spaces, here is a list of
some of the ones we're aware of. Not all of them are open, and some of them are
only partly related to what OpenTrials is doing, but if you are working in this
space too, you might find the links useful.

If you'd like to write a one or two sentence summary of one of these projects, please email it and we'll add it.
